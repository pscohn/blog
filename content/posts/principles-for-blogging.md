Blogging is easy to start, but hard to make into a habit. So to prevent becoming the latest two-post graveyard to haunt the web, I thought I'd come up with some principles for writing this blog that I'll try to keep.

First, briefly, some of my goals for this blog are to:

- document my learning progress
- have a place to review what I've learned
- learn things more deeply by writing about them
- improve my technical writing and explaining
- in a best-case scenario, help someone else in their learning

And now, the principles.

## 1. Keep it up

I'll get the most obvious one out of the way first. This whole blogging thing won't do any good if I get lazy after the first month. Even if I can only find the time for one post a month, I'll try make this a regular part of my study.

## 2. Accept that I will write things that are wrong.

One of the blockers a newer programmer like me might face when thinking about blogging is that we're not an authority on anything. Why blog if there's hundreds or thousands of other bloggers who are way smarter and have more experience?

The point of this blog isn't to be an authority on anything, and that means it's not necessarily going to be correct all the time. I'll try to be as thorough and accurate as possible, but I'll make mistakes. The important thing is to not let that stop me from doing it, and hopefully by putting those mistakes in writing I'll learn from them faster.

## 3. Accept that most of what I write may be common knowledge.

Again, I'm not the authority on anything. If I want to use this blog to learn things, I'll have to write posts that have been written before by other people, and write about things you might find more easily on Wikipedia. As long as a post could benefit at least one person (including me), it's worth writing.

## 4. Be open and humble

When I do make mistakes or voice opinions that may be bad ones, it will be important to be available for feedback and take it without ego. The point isn't to be smarter than anyone else, it's to learn - and I can do that better if there are other people to correct me or provide different points of view. Now, I don't know if anyone will actually read this besides me, but there should always be a way to contact me through the blog, and I'll try to accept criticisms gracefully, correct mistakes, and expand on things that need expanding.

I'll do my best to follow these principles in this blog, and if I don't - or you have any feedback or suggestions for other principles - please bug me.

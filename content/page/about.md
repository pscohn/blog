Hi, I'm Paul.

I'm a software engineer for [Rainforest QA](https://rainforestqa.com) based in NYC. I started learning to code on my own in 2014 and attended the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) in the Winter 2 batch in 2015.

Before that, I was a jazz guitarist and teacher, but now I mainly practice piano in my spare time. I might post some new things to [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/paulcohnmusic) in the future.

I'll use this blog to write about things I'm learning, practice explaining things I think I know, and maybe leave some random thoughts about random things.
